\section {Introduction}

This project consists in building an image classification system, which takes images as input and gives a prediction -in percentages- of what would be on these given images. For instance, the system may receive an image of a human face as input, after treating the data, the output is then represented in a small list of objects that may be on the picture, ordered by their probability percentages. In this case, the system should display a list, whose first element "human face" is, next to the probability which the system calculated for this result.

The motivation behind this project is artificial neural networks. These are computing systems which were inspired by the biological neural network of an animal. Such systems gain knowledge in executing tasks -in our case image recognition- through a certain training. For an image recognition neural network to correctly perform its task, it is required to analyze examples of images that have been manually labeled. Other uses where artificial neural networks are deployed are predictions, function approximations, or real life patterns recognition...

Nowadays, machine learning is gaining in importance as the goal of including machines in various activities -industries, services, economy- in order to reach high levels of efficiency is in need of artificial intelligence. Indeed, under the applications of artificial neural networks, we can mention autonomous driving, natural language processing, gesture recognition, and of course, face recognition, which is the main application of this project.

It must not be forgotten to mention as well, that there exists different neural networks models, such as Back-Propagation, Boltzmann Machines and Deep Neural Networks, with which we will deal in this project. In particular, we will deal with "AlexNet", which is a convolutional neural network consisting of 8 layers, 5 of which are convolutional while the others are fully-connected layers.

On one hand, deploying deep neural networks not only means unlocking a massive parallelism potential for our system, but it also means that unsupervised learning is most definitely possible. On the other, we are in need of a huge data set for this unsupervised training. It is important to mention as well, that deep neural networks require intense computations, which manifests itself in high power consumption and learning and classification time.

For the sake of decreasing the number of disadvantages of deep neural networks, the decision of using heterogeneous platforms such as CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs was made. These will provide the system with a good performance for a wide range of computations, as well as a decent usage of pipelines and parallelism, and of course, all with low power consumption.

To take a taste at the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial neural networks, we invite you to try out our image recognition system, and maybe even have a little fun with it.

\section{Product Use}

\subsection{Field of application}
 
This program is designed for image classification. The user or system can use this program to recognize pre-specified or learned objects. Because the system runs on heterogeneous platforms, the user is allowed to switch between various operation modes depending on power or performance preferences.

Victims of strokes or memory problems have a hard time recognizing even the most simple objects we deal with everyday. Building on this system, it would be possible to help these people to rebuild their memories or label the objects presented on the images. It can also help the visually disabled have a better idea about their environment through processing images they choose.
Another application of this system is the optimization of the traffic lights through equipping them with a functionality that would set the traffic free for other sides, if the current side is empty.

We can think about a use in the tourism field as well, as tourists may want to have a better idea about buildings or statues of the city they are visiting, which they can do through our system.

\subsection{Target Group}

	\item people with impaired vision

\section{System Model}

Programming with less complexity makes delightful code that is less buggy and easier to maintain because it is reusable without modification. In order to achieve this goal we use in this context the MVC architecture which consists of three parts: Model, View and Controller.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/MVC.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Model}

The model represents the domain. The model does not depend on the controller or the view. It contains the pretrained neural network model AlexNet as well as the classification algorithm to be used on images.The neural network itself is composed of a set of weights and topology. The topology sepecifies how the layers interact with each other. On the other hand the weights define when the neurons are activated. The layers are invoked by the scheduler which is responsible for resolving dependencies between them.

\pagebreak



\subsection{View}

The view displays the model data. The model data is in this case the input images,  the output results and the chosen operation mode as well as the current state of the process (e.g. in pause, running, waiting for input). Besides it sends user actions (e.g. button clicks, inputs) to the controller. It represents the graphical user interface which allows the user to interact with the system (See Graphical User Interface)

\subsection{Controller}

The controller interprets user actions such as button clicks. It depends on the view and the model and controls the interactions between them.

\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Neural Network:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. The neural network itself is a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item AlexNet
	\begin{itemize}
		\item AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network, designed by Alex Krizhevsky, and published with Ilya Sutskever and Krizhevsky's PhD advisor Geoffrey Hinton, who was originally resistant to the idea of his student.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item GoogLeNet
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GoogLeNet uses a CNN inspired by LeNet but implemented a novel element which is dubbed an inception module. It used batch normalization, image distortions and RMSprop. This module is based on several very small convolutions in order to drastically reduce the number of parameters. Their architecture consisted of a 22 layer deep CNN but reduced the number of parameters from 60 million (AlexNet) to 4 million.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item GPU
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GPU (graphics processing unit) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item FPGA
	\begin{itemize}
		\item FPGA (field-programmable gate array) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence the term "field-programmable".
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item ASIC
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ASIC ( application-Specific Integrated Circuit ) is an integrated circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency Bitcoin miner is an ASIC. Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item OpenCL
	\begin{itemize}
		\item OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms consisting of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other processors or hardware accelerators.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Hardware Acceleration
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In computing, hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware specially made to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose CPU. An operation can be computed faster in application-specific hardware designed or programmed to compute the operation than specified in software and performed on a general-purpose computer processor.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item High Performance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer performance is the amount of work accomplished by a computer system. Depending on the context, high performance means high processing speed in this project.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Power Consumption
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Power Consumption in this project is a form of energy consumption that uses electric energy. Electric energy consumption is the actual energy demand made on existing electricity supply.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Energy Efficiency
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Energy Efficiency means a ratio of the measured performance to electrical power consumed.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item GUI
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GUI (graphical user interface ) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Ubuntu
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ubuntu is a free and open-source operating system and Linux distribution based on Debian.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item QT
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Qt is a cross-platform application framework and widget toolkit for creating classic and embedded graphical user interfaces.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Real-time
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In computer science, real-time computing (RTC), or reactive computing describes hardware and software systems subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from event to system response. Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as "deadlines".
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\item Thumbnail
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures or videos, used to help in recognizing and organizing them, serving the same role for images as a normal text index does for words.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
